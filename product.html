        <p class="card-text">Wastewater is used water originating from domestic, industrial, agricultural, and medical or transport activities. Used water becomes wastewater upon the difference in its quality, composition and/or potentially temperature.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">The aim of wastewater treatment is to minimise the concentrations of specific contaminations to the dimension at which the discharge of the effluent will not adversely affect nature or represent a well-being risk. Moreover, the reduction of these constituents needs only be to some required level. Although water can technically be completely purified by distillation and deionisation, this is unnecessary and may actually be detrimental to the receiving water. Fish and other organisms cannot survive in deionised or distilled water.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">For any given wastewater in a particular location, the degree and type of treatment are variables that require engineering and biological decisions. Often the degree of treatment depends on the assimilative capacity of the receiving water for the process. The amount of BOD that must be removed is an effluent standard and dictates in large part the type of wastewater treatment required.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">Additional effluent standards could have been established, but for illustrative purposes, we consider only these five. The treatment system selected to achieve these effluent standards includes the following process.</p>
        <p class="card-text"><strong>Primary treatment: </strong> physical processes which involve sedimentation of solid waste within the water and homogenise the remaining effluent. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text"><strong>Secondary treatment: </strong>biological processes that remove most of the biochemical demand for oxygen (BOD) from the water and makes use of oxidation to further purify wastewater. This method can be done in three ways: Bio-filtration, aeration and oxidation ponds.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text"><strong>Tertiary treatment:</strong>physical, biological, and chemical processes to remove nutrients like phosphorus and inorganic pollutants, to deodorise and decolourise effluent water, and to carry out further oxidation process. Substances like activate carbon and sand are among the most commonly used materials that are used in tertiary treatment.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">Warranium Energy introduces WarraniumMBR(Membrane Bio-Reactor), a state-of-the-art membrane separation technology and WarraniumMBBR (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor) for the streams like Domestic sewage, Primary and secondary wastewater, Pre-treatment for RO, cooling tower blowdown and municipal and industrial sector respectively.</p>

        <h3 class="card-heading" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">Rain Water Harvesting</h3>  
        
        <p class="card-text">Climate Change is evident in the change of precipitation trends that include large annual fluctuation of rainfall and snowfall, thus an increase in erratic rains. This has equal impact on water bodies such as rivers, lakes as well as groundwater sources such as aquifers which have reported a drastic change of water volume, an increase of water temperature and the declining water quality.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">Water shortage and quality issues have risen as basic and critical concern worldwide. Water is lost from the phase of the earth in several ways, including evaporation, animal and plant consumption and largely through human-related development projects. In general, the high demand on water resources for development globally has put water resources under pressure; hence there is an immediate need to urgently find innovative opportunities that will enable development and human well being without undermining ecosystem services. However, there is only one way in which water comes back or it's regulated back to the earth; through rainfall.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">The most wasted water is the spillover, which goes to the ocean alongside the most fertile soil. “The running water has to be made to creep, the crawling water is to soil and get stored, to be utilised in the dry days," This is the straightforward meaning of rainwater harvesting.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) is a method of collecting, storing and conserving local surface runoff rainwater.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">Water is essential to all life – human, creatures and vegetation. It is therefore important that sufficient supplies of water be created to support such life. Development of water supplies ought to be embraced in such a way as to preserve the hydrological balance and the organic functions of all ecosystems.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">Therefore Rain Water Harvesting is very essential for humans, creatures and plants.</p>

        <h4 class="card-text">Reduce your carbon footprint</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">Unlike energy generated by fossil fuels, solar doesn’t release harmful carbon dioxide (CO₂) emission. Sustainable carbon- free energy solutions such as solar are essential to slowing the pace of climate change and preventing further harm to the environment.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="card-text">Save on electricity bills</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">Installing solar panels significantly reduces the load of monthly electricity bills and dependence on the power grid. Solar energy independence protects against rising electricity costs and volatile fuel prices. With analysts forecasting continued increases in power unit rates, solar remains a cost- effective solution and long-term investment in the future.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="card-text">Increase property value</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">Studies have appeared properties with solar systems sell up to 20 percent faster and at a 17 percent premium contrasted to homes without such systems. A solar installation makes your property progressively appealing to buyers, increasing its resale esteem.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="card-text">Let Sunlight Power your Life</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">Warranium Energy’ solar power projects business segment designs, constructs, operates and sells solar power projects in India. Warranium Energy takes part in the full life-cycle of solar energy projects development including project requirement, permitting, design, engineering, procurement, installation, construction, monitoring, operation and maintenance.</p>

        <h3 class="card-heading" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">Solid Waster Management</h3>  

        <h4 class="card-text">Solid Waste Terminology</h4> 
         <br>
        <p class="card-text">Solid waste is the unwanted or useless solid materials produced from human activities in residential, industrial or commercial areas. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) - more regularly known as garbage or trash - comprises of everyday items we use and then throw away, such as product packaging, furniture, appliances, paint, clothing, bottles, grass clippings, food scraps, newspapers and batteries. This originates from our homes, schools, hospitals, and organisations.</p>
        <br>
       <h4 class="card-text">Where does our Trash go</h4>
       <br>
       <p class="card-text">India is facing a huge solid-waste disposal problem, especially in urban areas. In metro cities in India, an individual produces an average of 0.8 kg/waste/person daily basis. Municipal Solid Waste typically contains 51% organic waste, 17% recyclables, 11% hazardous and 21% inert waste. However, about 40% of all Municipal Solid Waste isn't gathered at all and hence lies littered in the city/town and finds its way to nearby drains and water bodies, causing choking as well as contamination of surface water. Unsegregated collection of waste and its transportation leads to dumping in the open areas, which produces leachate and gaseous emissions besides causing an annoyance in the surrounding environment. Leachate contaminates the groundwater as well as surface water in the vicinity and gaseous emissions contribute to global warming.</p>
       <br>
       <h4 class="card-text">Services’ for Waste Management</h4>
       <br>
       <p class="card-text">Solid Waste Management reduces or eliminates the adverse impact on the environment and human health. Various number of processes are involved in effectively managing Municipal Solid Waste. Warranium Energy offers a complete solid waste management solution for commercial and industrial waste collection, transfer stations, waste transfer, recycling activities, landfill management and material trading.</p>
